### Data Preparation

Data Preparation Strategy

  1. Identify Necessary Data and Datasets:\
  Based on the research problem, identify and define the specific types of data required. Consider datasets that contain examples of cultural mediation in tourism, as well as the linguistic and technical challenges faced in the translation and localization of tourism websites.\

<!-- For me, and possibly others, an example of what would consistute 'cultural mediation' would be useful to help understand primary question that your are framing here. -->

  2. Data Acquisition:\
  Locate sources where the required data can be accessed. This may involve collecting data from tourism websites, translation archives, or datasets available in linguistic and tourism research communities.\

  3. Data Curation:\
    - Assess the quality and relevance of the collected data. This involves filtering out irrelevant content and ensuring the data aligns with the research problem.\
    - Organize the data, tagging it based on categories such as language, type of cultural content, translation approach, and source vs. target language content.

  4. Data Transformation:\
  Normalize and preprocess the data for analysis. Tokenize text data, identify and extract key terms and phrases related to cultural mediation and linguistic features highlighted in the tourism and translation studies.

Reflect on the Process

Document the steps taken, challenges faced, and decisions made during the data preparation phase.

Develop a Plan for Analysis

Outline how you will analyze the prepared data to address your research problem.

## Select the aligned data and/ or datasets

- Step 1: Data Identification and Acquisition
  - Source Online Travel Guides and Websites: Identify and collect data from various online travel guides and tourism websites.

<!-- Have you identified any sites? Sources? What did you see in the primary literature? Identifying potential sources grounds the research and suggests that it is feasible -->

- Step 2: Data Curation
  - Filtering: Exclude data irrelevant to cultural mediation or that doesn't pose significant translation challenges, such as purely transactional content (e.g., booking forms).
  - Categorization: Organize the data into categories based on language pairs, type of cultural content (e.g., historical, culinary), and the nature of translation challenges identified.

<!--

These, and subsequent, steps will really depend on the sources that our can identify. To be able to provide a more detailed plan, you will need to identify the sources that you could use.

-->

- Step 3: Data Transformation for Analysis
  - Normalization: Ensure consistency across the dataset by standardizing the format of the text (e.g., removing HTML tags, standardizing encoding).
  - Alignment: Align translated texts with their source texts to facilitate comparative analysis, paying special attention to how cultural elements are translated.

- Step 4: Annotation for Cultural and Linguistic Features
Manual Annotation.


### Assessing your progress

Reflect on the process of identifying a data preparation strategy.
Some questions to consider:

- What did you learn?\
  I learnt that the research field is multi-displinary nature and the data complex. The variety and complexity of data that needs to be curated for this research highlighted the intricate relationship between language, culture, and technology.

- What did you find most/ least challenging?\
  Most Challenging:  This involves subjective judgement influenced by linguistic, cultural, and personal biases, necessitating a robust framework to minimize subjectivity.

- What resources did you consult?\
Academic Literature: Research articles and books on cultural mediation, translation studies, and tourism marketing provided foundational knowledge and theoretical frameworks relevant to the study.\
Online Resources: Utilized online repositories, databases, and search engines to identify and access online travel guides and tourism websites.


<!--

It sounds like you've made more progess than you've indicated here. You've outlined the general approach to data preparation, but you could provide more detail on the specific sources you've identified and how you plan to use them. This would help to ground the project in the data that you have available.
